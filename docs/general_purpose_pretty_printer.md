### Implementing a General Purpose Pretty Printer in Java

Based on your question about implementing a general purpose pretty printer in Java (similar to Python's `pprint`), I'll provide guidance on the types you should consider supporting.

### Scalar vs. Vector Types

You've correctly identified the two fundamental categories:

1. **Scalar/Primitive Types**: Values that don't contain other structured values
2. **Vector/Structured Types**: Values that can contain nested values

### Scalar Types to Support

Your list of scalar types is comprehensive:
- String
- Number and its subclasses (Integer, Double, Float, etc.)
- Boolean
- Character
- null
- BigInteger and BigDecimal
- Any other non-collection class

### Vector Types to Consider

For structured/vector types, here are the key interfaces and classes to consider:

#### 1. Collection Interfaces

- **Iterable**: The most general interface for any collection that can be iterated over. Supporting this would give you the broadest coverage.
- **Collection**: The root interface in the collection hierarchy.
- **List**: Ordered collections (ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.)
- **Set**: Collections that cannot contain duplicate elements (HashSet, TreeSet, etc.)
- **Queue/Deque**: Collections designed for holding elements prior to processing

#### 2. Map Interface

- **Map**: As you noted, Map has no supertype in the Collection hierarchy. It's a separate interface for key-value pairs.

#### 3. Specific Considerations

- **SequencedCollection** (Java 21+): This is a newer interface that represents collections with a defined encounter order. Supporting both this and Iterable would be ideal, as they serve different purposes.
- **Arrays**: While not collections, arrays should be handled specially.
- **Optional**: Consider handling Java's Optional type specially.
- **Record types**: These are structured data but might need special handling.

### Implementation Strategy

Based on the JsonPrettyPrinter implementation in your project, I recommend:

1. **Type Detection Hierarchy**:
   - First check if the object is null
   - Then check if it's a primitive/scalar type
   - Then check if it's a Map
   - Then check if it's an Iterable
   - Then check if it's an array
   - Finally, treat anything else as a scalar with toString()

2. **Recursive Processing**:
   - For Maps: Process each key-value pair
   - For Collections/Iterables: Process each element
   - For Arrays: Process each element
   - For scalar types: Format appropriately

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Implement a mechanism to detect cycles in object references to prevent infinite recursion

### Example Type Hierarchy

```java
interface PrettyPrintable {
    String prettyPrint(int indentLevel);
}

// For scalar types
class ScalarPrinter implements PrettyPrintable {
    private final Object value;
    // Implementation...
}

// For collection types
class CollectionPrinter implements PrettyPrintable {
    private final Iterable<?> collection;
    // Implementation...
}

// For map types
class MapPrinter implements PrettyPrintable {
    private final Map<?, ?> map;
    // Implementation...
}

// Main printer class
class PrettyPrinter {
    public static String print(Object obj) {
        // Determine type and delegate to appropriate printer
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

For the most general implementation, support:
1. All primitive wrapper types as scalars
2. Map interface for key-value structures
3. Iterable interface for all collection-like structures
4. Arrays as a special case
5. Any other class as a scalar (using toString())

This approach will give you a flexible pretty printer that can handle virtually any Java object while providing specialized formatting for common collection types.
